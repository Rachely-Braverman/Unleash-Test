Refresh tokens are the credentials that can be used to acquire new access tokens.


The lifetime of a refresh token is much longer compared to the lifetime of an access token.


An access token is a string that identifies a user, an application, or a page. 
The token includes information such as when the token will expire and which app created that token.

First, it is necessary to acquire OAuth 2.0 client credentials from API console.

Then, the access token is requested from the authorization server by the client.

It gets an access token from the response and sends the token to the API that I wish to access.


When current access tokens expire or become invalid, the authorization server provides refresh tokens 
to the client to obtain new access token.
